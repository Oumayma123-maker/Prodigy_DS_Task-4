# Prodigy InfoTech Internship : Task 4 :

Task 4: Social Media Sentiment Analysis and Visualization 📊💬 :

Overview :

In this project, I analyzed sentiment patterns in social media data (primarily from Twitter 🐦). The goal was to understand public opinion and attitudes towards various topics and brands. Using sentiment analysis, I classified tweets into four sentiment groups: Positive 😊, Negative 😡, Neutral 😐, and Irrelevant 🤷‍♂️. The visualizations, including word clouds, helped derive insights into these sentiment patterns.

Objectives 🎯 :

🧹 Data Cleaning: Preprocess and clean the social media data.

🧠 Sentiment Analysis: Categorize tweets into Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Irrelevant.

📊 Data Visualization: Visualize sentiment distribution across topics and brands.

🔍 Insights: Understand trends in public sentiment towards brands and topics.

Process 🔄 :

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 🧽:

Removed duplicates and irrelevant content.

Extracted relevant features from the tweets (e.g., topics and brands).

Prepared the data for sentiment analysis by handling missing values and formatting text.
3. Sentiment Analysis 🧠 :

Used a sentiment analysis model to classify the tweets into categories: Positive 😊, Negative 😡, Neutral 😐, and Irrelevant 🤷‍♂️.

Focused on popular brands and topics, including:

🛒 Amazon

🎮 MaddenNFL

⚔️ AssassinsCreed

🪖 Battlefield

4. Visualization 📊 :
   
Created visualizations (bar charts 📊, pie charts 🥧, and word clouds ☁️) to show sentiment distribution.

WordClouds were used to highlight the most frequently mentioned words in each sentiment category, providing a visual representation of common themes and topics within the sentiments.

Key visualizations:

Negative sentiment (😡) dominated for MaddenNFL.

Positive sentiment (😊) was most prevalent for AssassinsCreed.

Neutral sentiment (😐) was high for Amazon.

Battlefield had the highest proportion of Irrelevant sentiment (🤷‍♂️).

Generated word clouds to visualize the most common words associated with each sentiment.

6. Key Insights 🔍 :
   
Sentiment Breakdown:

Negative (😡): 30.3%

Positive (😊): 27.5%

Neutral (😐): 24.7%

Irrelevant (🤷‍♂️): 17.5%

-Most tweets analyzed were under 400 characters, showing that users tend to express themselves concisely.

-The analysis provides valuable insights into public opinion on these brands.

Conclusion ✅:

This sentiment analysis reveals how people feel about certain topics and brands on social media. By visualizing the sentiment data, including word clouds, we gain an understanding of public opinion, which can guide businesses in assessing their brand image and customer sentiment.
